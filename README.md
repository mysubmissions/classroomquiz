## Inspiration

The inspiration for Classroom Quiz comes from the growing need for interactive, digital solutions in education. With many teachers and students adapting to hybrid and online learning, there's a clear need for a tool that can make assessments smoother and more efficient.

## What it Does

As of now, Classroom Quiz is in its initial phase. The app allows teachers to sign up and log in using Firebase Authentication. Teachers can view a user interface that would potentially allow them to create, manage, and conduct quizzes online. Though the quiz functionalities are yet to be implemented, the UI shows what the future could holdâ€”like creating multiple-choice questions, assigning quizzes, and viewing performance data.

## How I Built It

The app is primarily built using Kotlin for the Android application and Jetpack Compose for the user interface. For real-time database and authentication, Firebase is used. The MVVM architecture pattern is implemented using ViewModel, making the code more maintainable and testable.

## Challenges I Ran Into

The current challenge has been to successfully implement Firebase for teacher authentication. Designing an intuitive user interface that is user-friendly for teachers with varying levels of tech-savvy was also a challenge.

## Accomplishments That I'm Proud Of

I have successfully implemented the sign-up and login functionalities for teachers using Firebase and ViewModel. Even in its initial phase, the app has a UI design that lays the groundwork for future features.

## What I Learned

I've learned about Firebase Authentication and gained more hands-on experience with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The importance of following good architecture practices via MVVM was also a significant takeaway.

## What's Next for Classroom Quiz

The immediate next steps include implementing the quiz creation and management functionalities. This would involve real-time database operations to store quiz data and enable interactions between teachers and students. Future plans also include expanding to different types of questions and possibly launching a web version.
